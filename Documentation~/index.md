# Streaming Image Sequence

Streaming Image Sequence is a package for playing sequential image sequences in Unity Timeline 
easily without making Unity 2D Sprites.  
It is designed with the following principles in mind:

1. Can avoid texture importing time entirely by using 
   [StreamingAssets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StreamingAssets.html).
1. Offers smooth image playback, both in play mode and in timeline editing mode.
1. Supports multiple OS.

**Using Timeline 1.4.x or above is recommended.**

## Supported Platforms

1. Windows
2. Mac
