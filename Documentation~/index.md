# Streaming Image Sequence

Streaming Image Sequence is a package for playing sequential image sequences in Unity Timeline 
easily without making Unity 2D Sprites.

# Supported Platforms

1. Windows
2. Mac

# Basic Usage 

1. Create an empty *GameObject* and add a *Director* component to it
1. Copy the sequential images in a folder under *StreamingAssets*
1. Open the Timeline window, if not opened yet
1. Add a StreamingImageSequenceTrack in the Timeline Window

   <img src="images/AddStreamingImageSequenceTrack.png" width=180>  
   
1. Drag and Drop the sequential images folder under *StreamingAssets* to the StreamingImageSequenceTrack added previously
 
   <img src="images/DragAndDropStreamingAssets.png" width=960>  
   
1. Create an Image object by clicking the menu: GameObject -> UI -> Image

1. Drag and drop the Image object to the object property of StreamingImageSequenceTrack, and click *Create StreamingImageSequenceNativeRenderer on Image* 

   <img src="images/CreateStreamingImageSequenceNativeRenderer.png" width=960>  

1. The image sequences in the folder will then be shown inside the Image object, 
   and the Image object will be played/enabled/disabled as we play the Timeline or drag the time slider of the Timeline window
